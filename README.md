# IMC Prosperity 2
### Introduction
IMC Prosperity is an annual trading challenge, in which participants from universities all across the globe compete to maximise their profits through algorithmic and manual trading. This years competition spanned over 15 days with 5 rounds, at the end of each round it was required we submit our trading algorithm (programmed in python) and some strategy for the manual trading, established through solving various problems. Once the challenge cocluded my final position was xxth out of 10,000 teams worldwide and xth in the UK.
### Round 1
#### Algorithmic
In round 1 amethysts and starfruit were introduced to the archepelego. I noticed that amethysts had a consistent mean around 10,000 with little variance. My team and I decided it would be effective to market make when bid and ask prices were inside a range of +/- 2 from the mean and market take when outside of this. For starfruits we employed a trend following strategy using a linear regression.
